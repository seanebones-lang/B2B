## Decision: Continue to Next Iteration

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Made measurable progress (+3 points)
- ✅ Addressed critical P0 issues (security, performance, reliability)
- ⚠️ Still significant gaps remaining (-207 points total)
- ⚠️ Not yet at 100/100 perfection
- ✅ System is stable and improved

**Recommendation:** **CONTINUE TO ITERATION 10**

## Next Iteration Focus (Iteration 10)

### Priority 1: Complete Phase 1 Tasks
1. **Complete edge case handling** - Enhance scraper error handling
2. **Add load testing** - Verify scalability claims
3. **Measure actual test coverage** - Run coverage measurement

### Priority 2: Begin Phase 2 Tasks
4. **Complete type hints** - 95% type coverage
5. **Add minimal REST API** - 3-4 endpoints
6. **Simple cost tracking** - Basic cost monitoring

### Expected Impact
- Functionality: 92 → 95/100 (+3)
- Performance: 85 → 90/100 (+5)
- Maintainability: 92 → 95/100 (+3)
- Cost-Effectiveness: 70 → 80/100 (+10)

**Expected Score:** 90/100 (+2)
