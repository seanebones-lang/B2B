# Iteration 5: System Assessment

**Date:** January 2026  
**Starting Score:** 87/100 (from Iteration 4)

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Async scrapers created
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational
- ✅ Performance monitoring implemented
- ✅ Integration tests added

### High-Priority Gaps

1. **Async Integration** (Critical)
   - Async scrapers exist but not integrated
   - App still uses synchronous scrapers
   - Missing parallel processing

2. **Security Hardening** (High)
   - No secrets management system
   - No encryption at rest
   - Security headers not implemented

3. **Test Coverage** (85% → Target: 90%)
   - Need more edge cases
   - E2E tests incomplete
   - Performance tests needed

4. **Sphinx Documentation** (Medium)
   - Manual docs exist
   - Auto-generated API docs missing

## Focus Areas for Iteration 5

1. **Async Integration** - High impact on performance
2. **Security Hardening** - High impact on security score
3. **Test Coverage** - Reach 90% target
4. **Sphinx Setup** - Auto-generated docs
