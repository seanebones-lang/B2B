## Next Iteration Focus (Iteration 11)

### Priority 1: Complete Phase 1 & Phase 2
1. **Complete edge case handling** - Enhance scraper error handling
2. **Complete type hints** - 95% type coverage
3. **Add minimal REST API** - 3 endpoints
4. **Add security monitoring** - Basic monitoring

### Expected Impact
- Functionality: 93 → 96/100 (+3)
- Maintainability: 92 → 95/100 (+3)
- Security: 92 → 94/100 (+2)
- Usability: 75 → 80/100 (+5)

**Expected Score:** 92/100 (+2)
