# B2B Complaint-Driven Product Ideation App

A Streamlit web application that extracts unmet needs from 1-2 star reviews of popular B2B SaaS tools, identifies high-demand patterns, and uses xAI's Grok to generate actionable product ideas with 4-week roadmaps.

## 🎯 What This System Does

This application automates the process of complaint-driven product discovery by:

1. **Scraping Negative Reviews**: Automatically collects 1-2 star reviews from G2.com and Capterra for popular B2B SaaS tools
2. **Identifying Pain Patterns**: Uses keyword matching and machine learning clustering to find recurring complaint themes
3. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages xAI's Grok to analyze patterns, assess impact, and generate novel product ideas
4. **Actionable Roadmaps**: Creates detailed 4-week solo founder roadmaps for the top opportunities

The system treats every complaint as a "pre-paid invoice" from future customers, helping entrepreneurs identify validated market needs and build products that solve real problems.

## How It Works

1. **Review Scraping**: Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews with anti-detection (rotating user agents, delays)
2. **Pattern Extraction**: 
   - Keyword matching for pain categories (missing features, wishes, blockers)
   - ML clustering (TF-IDF + K-Means) to group similar complaints
   - Frequency filtering (5+ mentions or 15%+ of reviews)
3. **AI Analysis**: xAI Grok analyzes patterns and generates:
   - Top pain patterns with impact analysis
   - Product ideas (standalone apps, plugins, integrations)
   - 4-week solo founder roadmaps
4. **Report Generation**: Structured output with actionable insights

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to:
- Add/modify B2B tools
- Adjust pain keywords
- Change pattern detection thresholds
- Modify scraping settings

## Limitations & Notes

- **Scraping**: G2 and Capterra may block scrapers. The app includes error handling and fallbacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent overwhelming servers. Limit to 1-3 tools per run.
- **API Costs**: xAI API usage depends on review volume. Monitor your usage.
- **Review Quality**: Results depend on review availability and quality.

## Troubleshooting

**Scraping fails**: 
- G2/Capterra may have updated their HTML structure
- Try manual CSV upload (feature to be added)
- Check your internet connection

**xAI API errors**:
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your API quota/limits
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

**No patterns found**:
- Try selecting different tools
- Increase review count threshold in config.py
- Check if reviews contain complaint keywords

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Areas for improvement:
- Better scraping reliability
- Manual CSV upload fallback
- More sophisticated pattern detection
- Additional export formats
- UI/UX enhancements
